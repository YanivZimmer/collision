Video classification models take a video as input and return a prediction about which class the video belongs to. These models can be used to categorize what a video is all about. A real-world application of video classification is action / activity recognition, which is useful for fitness applications. It is also helpful for vision-impaired individuals, especially when they are commuting.\n",

We're using the [`pytorchvideo.data.Ucf101()`](https://pytorchvideo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/data/data.html#pytorchvideo.data.Ucf101) function because it's tailored for the UCF-101 dataset. Under the hood, it returns a [`pytorchvideo.data.labeled_video_dataset.LabeledVideoDataset`](https://pytorchvideo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/data/data.html#pytorchvideo.data.LabeledVideoDataset) object. `LabeledVideoDataset` class is the base class for all things video in the PyTorchVideo dataset. So, if you want to use a custom dataset not supported off-the-shelf by PyTorchVideo, you can extend the `LabeledVideoDataset` class accordingly. Refer to the `data` API [documentation to](https://pytorchvideo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/data/data.html) learn more. Also, if your dataset follows a similar structure (as shown above), then using the `pytorchvideo.data.Ucf101()` should work just fine.\n",
